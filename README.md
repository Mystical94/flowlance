# Flowlancer

Flowlancer is a platform designed to serve the needs of freelancers by offering tools and features that aim to improve their working experience.

## 📝 Project Description

### ✍ Project Overview
- The Flowlancer project's primary objective is to enhance the working experience for freelancers by providing them with a platform that facilitates efficient management of invoices and offers insights into the payment behavior of potential clients. The key goals of Flowlancer include:

    - Client Profile Transparency: Enable users to access and review detailed profiles of clients before engaging in work. This transparency helps freelancers make informed decisions about potential clients based on their background and behavior.

    - Blockchain Invoicing: Facilitate the sending of invoices through the Flow blockchain. Utilizing blockchain technology can enhance security, transparency, and efficiency in the invoicing and payment process.

    - Payment Behavior Analysis: Provide users with the ability to assess the payment behavior of clients in advance. This feature allows freelancers to gauge the reliability and trustworthiness of clients, helping them make safer decisions about their work engagements.

### 😎 Inspiration
